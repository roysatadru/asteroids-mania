# Asteroids mania

A fun project (built with ðŸ’• & ReactJS) to know more about Asteroids

## Targets

- Have to work with apis (so axios package can be used)
- Might have to pass differnt types of data to different areas of the app to different components, so we might need to use some kind of state management solution (so might use @reduxjs/toolkit)
- To apply cool animations, we might use framer-motion
- To route through page we will use react-router-dom
- Code should have a typical structure to let developers easily get what's going on in the project with hardly any comments (Readable code)
- Responsive UI
- User Experience flow should be optimal. Everything should be clear.
- Set up a github CI/CD pipeline to conveniently deploy the app to github pages
